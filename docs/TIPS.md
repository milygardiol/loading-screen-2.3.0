```

**Bad (Too Long):**

```

#### Clarity

**Good (Specific):**

✅ Your next session is Friday 7pm
```

**Bad (Vague):**

```

#### Relevance

```

... (5-10 total)

```

## Tip Rotation

### How It Works

- Tips automatically rotate during long loading times
- Smooth fade-out/fade-in transition
- Random selection from available tips
- Continuous rotation until loading completes

### Rotation Speed

**Setting**: Module Settings → **Tip Rotation**

**Range**: 3-15 seconds  
**Default**: 5 seconds

**Recommendations**:

| Tip Length           | Rotation Speed | Why                 |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Short (< 40 chars)   | 3-5 seconds    | Quick read, variety |
| Medium (40-80 chars) | 5-8 seconds    | Comfortable reading |
| Long (80+ chars)     | 8-12 seconds   | Enough time to read |
| Very Long (detailed) | 12-15 seconds  | Full comprehension  |

**Adjust via Settings:**

```
Settings → Module Settings → Loading Screen System
→ Tip Rotation → Slider (3-15 sec)
→ Save
```

### Animation

**Transition**:

- Fade out: 300ms
- Content change: Instant
- Fade in: 300ms
- Total: 600ms transition

**CSS Classes**:

- `.fade-out-tip` - Applied during fade-out

## Advanced Tips

### Conditional Tips (Manual)

While the module doesn't support conditional logic natively, you can manually update tips for different situations:

**Before Boss Fight:**

```javascript
await game.settings.set(
  "loading-screen",
  "customTips",
  "The boss is immune to poison\nFocus fire on the minions first\nSave your big spells\nHealing potions are in the chest",
);
```

**During Investigation:**

```javascript
await game.settings.set(
  "loading-screen",
  "customTips",
  "Look for clues in the study\nThe butler knows something\nCheck the fireplace\nThe diary is important",
);
```

**Between Sessions:**

```javascript
await game.settings.set(
  "loading-screen",
  "customTips",
  "Next session: Boss fight!\nLevel up your character\nBring snacks (your turn)\nReview combat rules",
);
```

### Multilingual Tips

**Same Tips in Multiple Languages:**

```
Tip: Save often (EN) | Tipp: Oft speichern (DE)
Tip: Check inventory | Tipp: Inventar prüfen
Tip: Next session Friday | Tipp: Nächste Session Freitag
```

**Language-Specific Tips:**

Create separate tip sets and switch based on language:

```javascript
const language = game.i18n.lang;
const tipSets = {
  en: "English tip 1\nEnglish tip 2\nEnglish tip 3",
  de: "Deutscher Tipp 1\nDeutscher Tipp 2\nDeutscher Tipp 3",
  es: "Consejo español 1\nConsejo español 2\nConsejo español 3",
};

await game.settings.set(
  "loading-screen",
  "customTips",
  tipSets[language] || tipSets.en,
);
```

### Dynamic Tips (Macro)

**Update Tips from Macro:**

```javascript
// Campaign-specific tips macro
const tips = [
  "Current quest: Find the Lost Crown",
  "Party gold: 1,547 gp",
  "Days until festival: 3",
  `Session date: ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}`,
];

await game.settings.set("loading-screen", "customTips", tips.join("\n"));
ui.notifications.info("Tips updated!");
```

**Time-Based Tips:**

```javascript
const hour = new Date().getHours();
let tips;

if (hour < 12) {
  tips = "Good morning!\nRemember breakfast\nCheck your spell list";
} else if (hour < 18) {
  tips = "Good afternoon!\nStay focused\nTake breaks";
} else {
  tips = "Good evening!\nWrap up by midnight\nNo late-night decisions";
}

await game.settings.set("loading-screen", "customTips", tips);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tips Not Showing

**Problem**: Tips section is blank

**Check**:

1. ✅ "Show Tips" is enabled in settings
2. ✅ Template supports tips (all do)
3. ✅ Custom tips aren't just empty lines
4. ✅ Browser console for errors

**Solutions**:

```javascript
// Verify tips are set
console.log(game.settings.get("loading-screen", "customTips"));

// Verify tips are enabled
console.log(game.settings.get("loading-screen", "showTips"));

// Test with simple tips
await game.settings.set(
  "loading-screen",
  "customTips",
  "Test Tip 1\nTest Tip 2",
);
```

### Tips Not Rotating

**Problem**: Same tip always shown

**Check**:

1. ✅ Multiple tips exist
2. ✅ Loading takes long enough
3. ✅ Rotation interval reasonable

**Solutions**:

- Add more tips (need at least 2)
- Increase scene complexity (longer load)
- Lower rotation interval to 3s

### Tips in Wrong Language

**Problem**: English tips for German user

**Check**:

1. ✅ Foundry language setting
2. ✅ Custom tips override language
3. ✅ Module has language files

**Solutions**:

- Clear custom tips (use defaults)
- Set custom tips in correct language
- Verify `game.i18n.lang` shows correct language

### Empty Line Issues

**Problem**: Blank tips or gaps

**Solution**: Remove empty lines in custom tips

**Before (Bad):**

```
Tip 1

Tip 2


Tip 3
```

**After (Good):**

```
Tip 1
Tip 2
Tip 3
```
